# Roadmap
This is the roadmap document. It outlines all future goals and a rough timetable.

## Milestone 1
TBD: 14th April
* Get basic app features going
** Saving/Loading sheets
** Discovering workers
* Create plugin system


## Brainstorming ideas

### Sheet management
How do I control what a worker displays? Maybe I can have a list of workers currently connected to the controller with color coding to indicate whether or not they're running something.
Then, when I want a sheet to be what the controller is "running", I could have a right-click context menu and have the option to "run on worker x".

## Previews
Have little windows running the same code as the workers to get some sort of live preview, but with much smaller resolution. Additionally, have a completely seperate preview-worker.
